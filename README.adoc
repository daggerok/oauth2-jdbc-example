//tag::content[]
For some reason, big part of software developers community do not care about security
I think main reason is because security hard topic. And it's really sad.

Main goal of that project is learn spring-security oauth2 (JDBC)
Because any enterprise application can't go live without security, I believe it should be done first!
You must avoid situation when big part of application architecture later may be rewritten to apply security...
